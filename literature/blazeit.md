# [BlazeIt: Fast Exploratory Video Queries using Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01046.pdf)

- Focuses on exploratory queries (queries that can help a user understand a video quickly) like
	- aggregate statistics (e.g. number of cars)
	- relatively rare events (e.g., events of many birds at a feeder)

- FrameQL
	- SQL-like querying language for complex visual queries over video
	- Optimizations for three common classes of queries: aggregation, scrubbing, and content-based selection
